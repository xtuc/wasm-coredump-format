# Wasm Coredump Format

> In computing, a core dump, [...] consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally. In practice, other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time, including the processor registers, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information. A snapshot dump (or snap dump) is a memory dump requested by the computer operator or by the running program, after which the program is able to continue. Core dumps are often used to assist in diagnosing and debugging errors in computer programs.

## Motivations

The motivations are the same than usual post-mortem debugging. The main target environment is serverless and client-side environments (like browsers) are not considered.

## Idea

When WebAssembly enters a trap, it starts unwinding and collects debugging information. For each stack frame, the state of the WebAssembly instance can be captured by collecting the values:
- in locals (includes function parameters)
- in globals
- on the stack 

Along with an instruction binary offset (relative to the code section, as specified by [DWARF]). All the information are written to a coredump file.

The post mortem analyze is done using the coredump file and [DWARF] informations. Similar to the debugging flow with [gdb].

### Runtime support

Most of the WebAssembly runtimes are already able to present a useful stacktrace on crash to the user. When they are configured to emit a coredump, they collect the debugging information and write a coredump file.

An example output:
```
$ wasmrun module.wasm

Exit 1: Uncaught RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds (core dumped).
``` 
A coredump file has been generated.

For experimenting, runtime support is not strictly necessary. A tools can transform the Wasm binary to inject code that will manually unwind the stack and collect debugging information, for instance [wasm-edit coredump]. Such a transformation has important limitations; a trap caused by an invalid memory operation or exception in a host function might not be caught.

### Security and privacy considerations

Using the WebAssembly linear memory for debugging exposes the risk of seeing, manipulating and/or collecting sensitive informations. Handling of sensitive data is out of scope.

No particular security considerations.

### Debugger support

[gdb] doesn't support Wasm coredump and it's unclear if it can. Wasm coredump differ from ELF coredump in a few significant ways:
- Wasm semantics; usage of locals, globals and the stack.
- The process image is only the Wasm linear memory.
- etc.

For experimenting, a custom tool has been built and mimics [gdb]: [wasmgdb].

## Coredump file format

The generated coredump is a binary file containing: 
- a snapshot of the WebAssembly linear memory or relevant regions.
- the `coredump` struct.

The placement of the `coredump` struct within the coredump file is not defined yet. However, for the sake of argument we assume it's at offset 0.

## `coredump` struct

The coredump struct starts with the numbers of frame recorded and the combined size of all frames, followed by the frames themself.

```
coredump ::= framecount:u32 size:u32 cont:frame*
```

> implementer note: since the `frame` struct doesn't have a fixed size, the `size` value can be used to append new frames because it's pointing at the end of the `coredump`.

```
frame ::= codeoffset:u32 locals:vec(local) globals:vec(global) stack:vec(stack) reserved:u32
```

The `reserved` bytes are decoded as an empty vector and reserved for future use.

`vec` (same encoding as [Wasm Vectors]):
```
vec(B) ::= n:u32 cont:B
```

`u32` are encoding using LEB128, like [Wasm u32].
